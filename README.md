In this project we wil be using a bio lamp.
The bio-lamp is a device that can be used to describe the ‘feelings’ of a plant.

Experiments shows that a plant creates two types of signals. The first is a slow changing wave that is a small and faster signal.
The second is a faster signal that depends on the frequency.
This device can check these signals and makes two RGB-LED active.
These LEDs can have different colours because the signals can change.

There is something weird about this project because you need to hurt the plant if you want to check the feelings of the plant.
If you want to check those signals you need to insert two needles in the soil of the plant.
